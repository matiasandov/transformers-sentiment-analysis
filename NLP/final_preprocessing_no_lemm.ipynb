       " '[\"What a fantastic week at NFT Paris ! 🥂 Met so many incredible people in the #Web3 space and I spent some quality time with team members I don\\'t often see face-to-face, like my CTO, Alexandre Cognard ! It was great sharing memories and talking about the progress made since I started at Arianee almost 2 years ago. Learning from him has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop my career and gain insight into other fields such as tech & management. Getting to know the ins and outs of their day-to-day work made me understand the tech team better. I gained insights into their viewpoints, strengthening mutual understanding & boosting alignment within the company. Thanks for the organization Alexandre Tsydenkov 🙌 Can\\'t wait for next year !\"]',\n",
       " '[\"Great coverage by Louise Laing of what\\'s happening in Digital Fashion from NFT Paris. User-Generated Content is taking off and The Sandbox stands as a transformative force in the digital fashion landscape. “The next big designer will emerge from a platform like The Sandbox with their customers recognising them as the next big brand.” This is validated by initiatives like the Art of Runway and collaborations with Digital Fashion Week 3D designers, known as voxel creators, can present their creations for sale in the game, gaining exposure to a different audience and garnering the opportunity to monetise from their creations whilst growing their digital community. https://lnkd.in/eHxX2UXZ @TrueStarsMedia @nft_paris @DgtlFashionWeek\"]',\n",
