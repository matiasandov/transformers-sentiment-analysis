"Last week I had the pleasure to NFT Paris by the hand of Arianee . Witnessing the transformative power of Web3 and NFTs in reshaping the concept of ownership, particularly in relation to our personal data, left me inspired and eager to delve deeper into the evolving landscape of decentralized technologies. The event sparked valuable insights, and I'm excited to continue navigating the dynamic realm of blockchain innovations. #NFTParis #Web3 #OwnershipRevolution",Positive
"Hello everyone Today, my friends Asma Ghamacha , Hermes Yan NTJAM NDJENG , Harold Geumtcheng , Aloys Aymrick Nzooh , Bryan Fozame and I had the chance to be part of the NFT Paris conference thanks to our school aivancity School for Technology, Business & Society Paris-Cachan where we learned a wealth of new information about blockchain, metaverse, web3 and its use cases across various industries such as finance, gaming, luxury, and more.

These conversations provided me with deeper insights into this innovative technology and its intersection with data science, particularly in terms of transparency and tokenization on the blockchain. #DataScience #Blockchain",Positive

"For a long time I imagined, this term or there was always something. Well, and now, regardless of the circumstances, I said that waiting is enough and that nothing more needs to be done for this to happen. Thus, I publicly presented my alter ego "The Knight with the Rose" ( https://lnkd.in/gDWS9mas ), my music group MonteCristo ( https://lnkd.in/g_p2V9KQ ), and the first NFT of my book! and combined it all into the NIGHT WITHOUT GAME event. With this, exactly what I have been doing all my life was born and made sense. Art, lecture, conversation, music... the masks have fallen, the games are gone. We are the only ones left who watch with our hearts!",Positive
"Brands can now create digital narratives where customers can actively participate, adding an immersive dimension to their marketing efforts. Imagine launching a product line where each item is accompanied by an NFT, each telling a different story of the brand's heritage or the product's journey. This approach not only enriches the customer experience but also fosters a deeper connection with the brand.",Positive

"A bit more than 17 300 entries over 2 days - NFT Paris was a blast !! Particularly proud of the attendance of major companies in the luxury, sport, gaming, finance, art sector and their support this year. Even Tesla was here ! NFTs are evolving, the sector is becoming more mature - From Hype to purpose introduction keynote from Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel is the defining theme of this edition. Once hype is gone, what remains ? 1 - A brilliant community & culture. 2 - Real use cases that finally appear. Slowly, then all at once - let the consolidation do its work.",Positive

"NFTs are revolutionizing the way we think about ownership and value in the digital world in ways that are deeper and more meaningful than having a customer’s email address. But, as with any nascent technology, there's a lot of complexity to navigate. That's where the NFT Management Platform (NMP) comes in to make web3 more accessible to brands. In this article, we'll explore why we created the NMP and the future we envision for it. #ArianeeAcademy #FeatureDigest",Positive
"Is this the best way to capitalize on a Web3 conference ? Some context : At the end of last year we decided with the BGA team to double down on our effort to provide an opportunity for BGA members and Web3 Gaming enthusiasts to network and learn from each other. We want #BGAConnects to be the embodiment of this new comitment. During NFT Paris, we were very happy to see that the different verticals of BGAConnects made sense for every atendee : 🎤 Learn from the experience of those who are innovating. We were very fortunate to have Yat Siu , Nicolas Gilot among many brilliant entrepreneurs in our 5 panels. 🏆 Give an opportunity for start ups to meet potential investors 🕹 Just... Play some games and meet the visionaries who are behing. One last note : Always try to contribute to other events based on the expertise you could provide as a network of professionals in a specific ecosystem. Super happy that our members had the chance to play a role in some of the best side events of NFT Paris. See our takeaways here : https://lnkd.in/eGHhc336",Positive

"What a fantastic week at NFT Paris ! 🥂 Met so many incredible people in the #Web3 space and I spent some quality time with team members I don't often see face-to-face, like my CTO, Alexandre Cognard ! It was great sharing memories and talking about the progress made since I started at Arianee almost 2 years ago. Learning from him has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop my career and gain insight into other fields such as tech & management. Getting to know the ins and outs of their day-to-day work made me understand the tech team better. I gained insights into their viewpoints, strengthening mutual understanding & boosting alignment within the company. Thanks for the organization Alexandre Tsydenkov 🙌 Can't wait for next year !",Positive
"Great coverage by Louise Laing of what's happening in Digital Fashion from NFT Paris. User-Generated Content is taking off and The Sandbox stands as a transformative force in the digital fashion landscape. “The next big designer will emerge from a platform like The Sandbox with their customers recognising them as the next big brand.” This is validated by initiatives like the Art of Runway and collaborations with Digital Fashion Week 3D designers, known as voxel creators, can present their creations for sale in the game, gaining exposure to a different audience and garnering the opportunity to monetise from their creations whilst growing their digital community. https://lnkd.in/eHxX2UXZ @TrueStarsMedia @nft_paris @DgtlFashionWeek",Positive
