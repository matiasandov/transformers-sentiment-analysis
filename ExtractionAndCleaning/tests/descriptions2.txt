Last week I had the pleasure to NFT Paris by the hand of Arianee . Witnessing the transformative power of Web3 and NFTs in reshaping the concept of ownership, particularly in relation to our personal data, left me inspired and eager to delve deeper into the evolving landscape of decentralized technologies. The event sparked valuable insights, and I'm excited to continue navigating the dynamic realm of blockchain innovations. #NFTParis #Web3 #OwnershipRevolution
Hello everyone Today, my friends Asma Ghamacha , Hermes Yan NTJAM NDJENG , Harold Geumtcheng , Aloys Aymrick Nzooh , Bryan Fozame and I had the chance to be part of the NFT Paris conference thanks to our school aivancity School for Technology, Business & Society Paris-Cachan where we learned a wealth of new information about blockchain, metaverse, web3 and its use cases across various industries such as finance, gaming, luxury, and more. During this enI had the privilege to engage in discussions with numerous brilliant web3 developers and CEOs from companies like Maxence Perray from Nomiks , Victor Briere from Arianee , Ubisoft , Louis Vuitton , and many others. These conversations provided me with deeper insights into this innovative technology and its intersection with data science, particularly in terms of transparency and tokenization on the blockchain. #DataScience #Blockchain
