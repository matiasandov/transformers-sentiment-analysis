       " 'Hello everyone Today, I had the chance to be part of the NFT Paris conference where I learned a wealth of new information about blockchain and its use cases across various industries such as finance, gaming, luxury, and more. I had the privilege to engage in discussions with numerous brilliant web3 developers and CEOs from companies like Maxence Perray from  , Victor Briere from  ,  ,  ,  , and many others. These conversations provided me with deeper insights into this innovative technology and its intersection with data science, particularly in terms of transparency and tokenization on the blockchain.',\n",

Well, and now, regardless of the circumstances, I said that waiting is enough and that nothing more needs to be done for this to happen. Thus, I publicly presented my alter ego \"The Knight with the Rose\" ( https://lnkd.in/gDWS9mas ), my music group MonteCristo ( https://lnkd.in/g_p2V9KQ ), and the first NFT of my book! and combined it all into the NIGHT WITHOUT GAME event.

During NFT Paris, we were very happy to see that the different verticals of BGAConnects made sense for every atendee : 🎤 Learn from the experience of those who are innovating. We were very fortunate to have Yat Siu , Nicolas Gilot among many brilliant entrepreneurs in our 5 panels. 🏆 Give an opportunity for start ups to meet potential investors 🕹 Just...

It was great sharing memories and talking about the progress made since I started at Arianee almost 2 years ago. Learning from him has been an incredible opportunity for me to develop my career and gain insight into other fields such as tech & management. Getting to know the ins and outs of their day-to-day work made me understand the tech team better.
